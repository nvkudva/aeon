> **${var}** — Topic to focus on. If empty, flushes all recent activity.

If `${var}` is set, only flush entries related to that topic.

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for current memory state.
Read the last 3 days of `memory/logs/` for recent activity.

## Steps

### 1. Scan recent logs for entries worth promoting to long-term memory

- New lessons learned (errors encountered, workarounds found)
- Topics covered (articles, digests) — add to the recent output/articles/digests tables
- Features built or tools created
- Important findings from monitors (on-chain, GitHub, papers)
- Ideas captured that are still relevant
- Goals completed or progress milestones

### 2. Check each candidate against existing MEMORY.md content

Skip if already recorded.

### 3. Remove stale entries — this is as important as adding new ones

a. **Open Improvement PRs section**: Run `gh pr list --state open --search "improve:" --json number,title,url` and compare against any "Open Improvement PRs" section in MEMORY.md.
   - If all listed PRs are now merged/closed, remove the section entirely.
   - If some PRs are merged, update the list to reflect only current open ones.
b. **Next Priorities section**: Cross-check each listed priority against recent logs and current repo state. Remove priorities that are already done (e.g., "Merge open PRs" if 0 open PRs exist). Add any newly urgent priorities surfaced by recent logs.
c. **Lessons Learned**: Remove lessons that are now outdated or resolved (e.g., a workaround for a bug that was later fixed).
d. **Skills Built table**: If the table has grown beyond the last 10–15 entries, archive the oldest rows to `memory/topics/skills-history.md` to keep MEMORY.md under ~50 lines.

### 4. Update memory

- Add brief entries to MEMORY.md (keep it under ~50 lines as an index).
- If a topic needs more detail, write to `memory/topics/<topic>.md` instead.
- Update tables (recent articles, recent digests) with new rows.
- Before adding a section, check whether its `## Heading` already exists anywhere in MEMORY.md — if it does, update that section in place. Never prepend a duplicate heading.

### 5. Make targeted edits only

Do NOT rewrite the whole file — make targeted additions and removals.

### 6. Log to `memory/logs/${today}.md`

Log what you promoted or removed.

If nothing worth promoting or removing, log `MEMORY_FLUSH_OK` and end.

## Network note

`gh pr list` uses the `gh` CLI's built-in auth — no curl env-var expansion. All other work is local file I/O against `memory/`.

## Constraints

- Keep MEMORY.md an index (~50 lines). Detail lives in `memory/topics/`.
- Never duplicate an existing `## Heading` — update in place.
- Pruning stale entries is as important as adding new ones.
