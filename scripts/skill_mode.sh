# skill_mode — capability tier resolution for a skill run (hardening §6).
#
# Two axes of capability: network (egress:, future proxy) and *write* (this).
# A skill declares its write tier in SKILL.md frontmatter:
#     mode: read-only      # may read repo + fetch web + notify; may NOT mutate the repo
#     mode: write          # full access (default, current behaviour)
#
# Default is `write` for backward compatibility: most skills legitimately write
# (create-skill, article, reflect…), so read-only is opt-in per SKILL.md.
# Enforcement is by allowedTools:
# read-only drops Write,Edit,Bash(git:*),Bash(gh:*) so the skill physically can't
# commit/push/edit. A post-run guard in the workflow reverts any stray writes that
# slipped through redirections, as defense-in-depth.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/skill_mode.sh mode <skill-name>     -> prints read-only | write
#   scripts/skill_mode.sh allowed-tools <mode>  -> prints the --allowedTools string
#   scripts/skill_mode.sh grok-args <mode>      -> prints grok CLI permission flags,
#                                                  one argv token per line (for the
#                                                  Grok Build harness; see run-grok.sh)

# Tools every tier gets: read, search, notify, and read-only/local shell helpers.
# curl stays (network is the *other* axis, governed by egress:, not by mode).
#
# NOTE: `gh` is intentionally NOT in the read-only base — even `gh api` GET reads are
# excluded, because `gh` is also a write vector (issue/PR/commit/dispatch) and the tool
# grammar is coarse (Bash(gh:*) is all-or-nothing). A read-only skill that needs GitHub
# data should fetch it with WebFetch/curl against api.github.com, or stay `mode: write`.
# (Known degraders today: github-trending + security-digest use `gh api` only as a
# fallback behind a WebFetch/curl primary, so they degrade gracefully, not break.)

# invocation ("requires approval") and the scan arm silently degrades to manual review —

# --- Grok Build harness permission mapping ----------------------------------
# The grok CLI uses a DIFFERENT permission grammar from Claude Code's
# --allowedTools: `--allow`/`--deny` rules over categories
# Bash/Edit/Read/Grep/Write/MCPTool/WebFetch, plus a `--permission-mode`.
# Bash rules use a space-glob — `Bash(git *)` — not Claude's colon `Bash(git:*)`.
#
# Permission mode: we pass `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` — the ONE mode
# grok actually wires headlessly (per grok's permissions docs + our testing). It
# APPROVES every tool call instead of refusing ones we didn't explicitly allowlist.
# That is deliberate and load-bearing: skills are authored for Claude Code and WILL
# reach for tools we never pre-listed (a `gh api` read, a Claude built-in). Under
# the old refuse-a-non-allowlisted-tool behavior (headless `dontAsk`), grok aborted
# the ENTIRE turn — stopReason=Cancelled, empty/partial output — which is exactly
# how Claude-authored skills failed on grok. Approving-all makes grok DEGRADE like
# Claude (a missing/failed tool returns an error the model routes around) instead
# of Cancelling. Paired with the --rules compat preamble in run-grok.sh.
#
# Consequence: the `--allow` rules below are now ADVISORY (additive grants, redundant
# under bypass) — kept only to document each tier's intended capability, NOT as the
# guard. The REAL guarantee that a read-only skill can't mutate is grok's OS-level
# `--sandbox read-only` profile (added below) plus the workflow's post-run stray-write
# revert. NEVER add `--deny` rules here: a denied tool can re-trigger the very
# turn-abort we are removing.
#
# We still mirror the SAME capability intent as BASE_TOOLS / WRITE_TOOLS above, so
# the intent reads identically on either harness: read-only documents no Edit and no
# git/gh/python; write adds them.
#
# Output: one argv token per line, so run-grok.sh can read it with
#   mapfile -t GROK_ARGS < <(skill_mode.sh grok-args "$MODE")
# and pass "${GROK_ARGS[@]}" straight through (a Bash rule's embedded space is
# preserved because each whole line becomes one array element).

# Bash command globs allowed on every tier (mirror BASE_TOOLS' Bash(...:*) set).
GROK_BASE_BASH="curl jq ./notify ./notify-jsonrender mkdir ls cat chmod date echo node npm npx head tail wc sort grep"
# Additional Bash command globs for the write tier (mirror WRITE_TOOLS).

# --- Grok Build run-shaping: frontmatter -> GROK_* env -----------------------
# Map optional per-skill frontmatter to the env vars run-grok.sh reads, so a
# skill can opt into grok's newer headless features without any workflow change:
#
#   effort: high            # low|medium|high|xhigh|max  -> --effort
#   reasoning_effort: high  # same set                   -> --reasoning-effort
#   max_turns: 60           # agentic-turn cap           -> --max-turns
#   best_of_n: 3            # run N ways, keep the best   -> --best-of-n
#   verify: true            # append a self-check loop    -> --check
#
# Output is `export GROK_X=...` lines for exactly the fields present (so unset
# fields fall through to run-grok.sh's defaults, and the scorer's own
# GROK_JSON_SCHEMA is never clobbered). aeon.yml's grok branch evals this.
# read one frontmatter scalar (first '---' block), stripping inline # comment,
